<h1> üè¥ Capture The Flag </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this Capture the Flag (CTF) event, I tested and enhanced my ethical hacking and defense capabilities by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in various systems. Using a "check and guess" approach, I tackled each challenge by attempting to solve potential problems, often without initially knowing the full scope of the vulnerability. This method, paired with research from online resources like articles and videos, as well as collaboration with peers, led to the discovery of multiple vulnerabilities. The exercise provided an opportunity to strengthen my proficiency in ethical hacking techniques, vulnerability detection, and defense strategies.
